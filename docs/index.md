# Welcome to Codecats CV

The aim of this course is to give you a glimpse into the world of web development as it is practiced today. The main challenge for a newcomer is that there is a vast array of technologies and languages to get a grasp on before you are able to understand how it all works.

In this course we are trying to give you a basic understanding about one possible technology stack by building a very simple application that makes use of all the technologies and brings them together.

As we will cover the complete process from idea to implementation and deployment the actual application is very simple but can be a good starting point to explore the technology further on your own. 

This documentation therefore is meant to accompany the course but also give you pointers for you own journey of exploration for which this course could be a starting point.
